This file documents the process for building the MIMC application installer.

The first step is to ensure you have a working Windows installation with the
current versions of all source files (CSS, HTML, JAVASCRIPT, PYTHON), which
**MATCH THE FILES IN THE SUBFOLDERS OF THIS ROOT FOLDER**, along
with public domain databases ("Cantes Espirtuales Publica.db3" and
"English Public Domain Hymns.db3").

Prior to zipping the Windows installation, perform these steps on the folders
in the prospective Windows root source (Miweb).

    Clean out the cache/.organizer.txt file (it should be an empty file).

    Delete all contents/files/folders in data folders:
        presentations/hymn
        presentations/scripture
        presentations/other
        tmp

    Update the documentation in the doc folder, adding any images to the
    doc/image folder that the html documentation references.

Then zip the Miweb folder to miweb.zip and move it to *THIS* (build) folder.

Run "python3 split.py miweb.zip". This will create about 5 files in the ../installer
folder (miweb.zip.00, miweb.zip.01, miweb.zip.02...).

Examine the ../installer/install.js file to make sure that all of the split file
names (and no extra files) are downloaded via the script. Edit and adjust as
necessary.

Move the split files, but not the original zip file (miweb.zip) to ../installer.
From the command line (in the build folder), type:

    mv miweb.zip.0* ../installer.

Create a branch on the distribution site to hold the new version files. Give it a
meaningful name and take note/copy it, because it will be used during the upload.

Edit the README.md file located in the root folder (../ from build). Add sufficient
explanation as to the changes that distinguish this branch.

Change directories to the root folder (../ from build) and then execute the
following commands to place files into the new branch.

git init
git add README.md
git commit -m ""            ## Enter a title for the commit
git branch -M <name>        ## Enter the branch name to commit to.
git remote add origin https://github.com/miweb-net/github-upload.git
git push -u origin <name>   ## Enter the branch name to push files to.
